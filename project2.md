## Project 2

Top-Down Unity Game

This project involves developing a top-down game in Unity, focusing on creating immersive gameplay through emergent realism. The game centres around a prisoner defeating prison guards in order to escape a maximum-security facility. It is a 2D top-down shooter game where the player must find ways to outsmart prison guards. The game showcases essential game design principles where players will navigate a dynamic setting filled with action and challenges and includes features such as collision detection and AI opponents. These opponents aim to mimic human-like tactical behaviour in order to create an immersive and engaging gameplay experience.
